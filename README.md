# math.do

math.do is an experimental node.js web application. It uses divide and conquer algorithms, combined with natural language processing and  expression evaluation to produce accurate mathematical results from an input query.

Although very similar in purpose to wolfram alpha (on which it is based), it has a few original features, such as the ability to visualize data algorithms (such as sorting, graphs, minimum distance between two points in a graph or matrix).

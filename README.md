# [math.do](https://mathdo.herokuapp.com/)

math.do is an experimental node.js web application. It uses divide and conquer algorithms, combined with natural language processing and  expression evaluation to produce accurate mathematical results from an input query.

It is very similar in purpose to wolfram alpha (on which it is based). It is, however, planned to have a few original features, such as the ability to visualize data algorithms (such as sorting, graphs, minimum distance between two points in a graph or matrix).

[Here](https://mathdo.herokuapp.com/) you can find the latest release version, hosted on heroku.

## What's in the box?

Implemented so far is a simple expression evaluation with built-in operator order. It can be used as a calculator for simple expressions, such as 2 + 2 or 17 * (3 + 4 / 5).
